:information_source: **What is this?**: 

This app explores data that was taken from Grailed, a large online marketplace catered to sell and buy menswear-- specifically clothes centered around streetwear and designer. Grailed takes a high fee: 9% commission for using their platform. This causes higher prices for listings in comparison to other sites like Depop.

Given user input, we will analyze either a certain product or brand through various analyses.

:bulb:: More details about the data can be found in the bottom left.

:computer: : The code will be available [here](https://github.com/ftaruc/projects) in the future.

:email: : Please email me if you have any questions through: `ferdie@berkeley.edu`
