#### :mag_right: **Dataset Description**

<small>This dataset fluctuates based on user configuration. However, some things remain consistent on how the data is pulled: it uses Selenium and Bs4. I received inspiration from several public scrapers that were kinda outdated which I will put below; the majority of them provided the foundation for future segments of code. I will explain thoroughly the process on how the data is retrieved on my personal blog soon. </small>
