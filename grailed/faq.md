**Q: How to get started?**

*A*: Fill out the configuration on the sidebar on the left! A button will appear after to get the data.

**Q: I entered my configuration but the button is not appearing!**

*A*: There are some limitations with the amount of listings you can retrieve. Please note that the amount has to be an integer `x` between `0 < x < 500` due to computational limitations.

**Q: Why is the amount of listings in the dataframe not matching with my initial query?**

*A*: Due to how the data is retrieved, there are some "empty listings" when going through the html on the website. This causes the amount of listings to be less than the amount you initially put in the configuration. This discrepancy is usually less than 10 *at most.*

**Q: What do some of the features in the dataframe represent?**

*A:* Please refer to the `Dataset Description` in the sidebar details that includes a feature dictionary that maps each feature name to a full description.

**Q: I ran to a bug, where can I report it?**

*A:* Please email me through `ferdie@berkeley.edu` as it's the fastest way to reach me.
